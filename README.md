This project consists of 2 parts:
- NodeMCU - lua script that runs on microcontroller (NodeMCU). NodeMCU is used to record, store and send data to remote Thingspeak server and to control the cooler. 
- CoolerControlApp - app written for Android that is used to display data downloaded from Thingspeak server and to send commands to NodeMCU. 

The repository features report that explains that way the app operates. 

The project was done for an assignment during my bachelor course of EE at Lodz University of Technology.
